title: Week 6 (6/24 - 6/28)
---

This week, I reworked the task of converting the Defects4J bugs into Maven projects after discovering issues with my previous script. Additionally, I read more articles to deepen my understanding of how to assess the correctness of patches.

Progress Update for this Week: 

  - 6/25/2024
      - In a group meeting with Dr. Ghanbari and fellow students, Dr. Ghanbari pointed out that my script for checking whether the projects are in Maven form was incomplete. It did not verify all essential components of a Maven project.
      - Researching on the internet, I discovered what constitutes a complete Maven project. I learned that a Maven project requires more than just a pom.xml file. It should also include the following directories:
          - src/main/java:
              - Purpose:
                  - This directory is intended for the main Java source code of the application. It is where all the core functionality of the project is implemented.
              - Functions:
                  - Houses all the Java classes and interfaces that form the application's business logic.
                  - The directory is organized into packages, which help in grouping related classes and managing the codebase efficiently.
                  - During compilation process, the source code in this directory is transformed into bytecode and placed in the target/classes directory.
                    
          - src/main/resources:
              - Purpose:
                  - This directory contains non-Java resource files needed by the application. These can include configuration files, properties files, XML files, and other types of files that the application might need at runtime.
              - Functions:
                  - Provides a central location for storing resources that the application will use during its execution.
                  - Commonly used for configuration files (e.g., application.properties, log4j.properties) which control various aspects of the applicationâ€™s behavior.
                  - During the build process, these resources are copied to the same output directory as the compiled Java classes (target/classes), making them accessible at runtime.

          - src/test/java:
              - Purpose:
                  - This directory is dedicated to Java test code. It contains the unit tests and integration tests for the application.
              - Functions:
                  - Stores test classes that verify the functionality of the code in src/main/java.  These tests are executed during the build process to ensure the correctness of the code.
                  - Frameworks like JUnit are often used to write tests in this directory.
                    
          - src/test/resources:
              - Purpose:
                  - This directory contains resource files needed specifically for testing, such as test data or configuration files for tests.
              - Functions:
                  - Stores resources required for executing tests, such as data files, mock configuration files, and other test-specific assets.
                  - Resources in this directory are kept separate from the main application resources to ensure a clean separation between test and production environments.
                  - During the test phase, these resources are copied to the target/test-classes directory, making them available to the test classes.

      - Synthesizing the insights gained from my research, I wrote the following script to convert Defects4J bugs into Maven projects, as shown below:

                                        # Define the base directory
                                        BASE_DIR="/home/jwangj001/patches-dataset"
                                        
                                        # Function to create a basic pom.xml file
                                        create_pom() {
                                            local project_dir=$1
                                            cat <<EOL > "$project_dir/pom.xml"

                                        echo "Conversion completed."
      - After running this script, all of the Defects4J bugs were successfully converted into Maven projects.
