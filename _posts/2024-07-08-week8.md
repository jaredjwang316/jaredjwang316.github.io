title: Week 8 (7/8 - 7/12)
---

This week, Hurricane Beryl hit Houston and greatly affected my community, leaving us without power and Wi-Fi access for several days. This caused me to be unable to work for 3 full days. Fortunately, on Wednesday night, I was able to check into a hotel to regain access to power and the internet. Once reconnected, I resumed the task from last week, focusing on analyzing and fixing the failed patches to ensure their tests pass.  The findings were similar to those of the previous week, including issues like syntax errors, incomplete patches, and patches passing some tests while failing others.

  - 7/11/2024
      - Continued analyzing and fixing the failed patches, ensuring their tests pass. 
  - 7/12/2024
      - Persisted with the task of identifying and resolving issues in the patches. 
  - 7/13/2024
      - Maintained efforts on fixing the failed patches.
