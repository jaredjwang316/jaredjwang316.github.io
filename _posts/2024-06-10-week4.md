title: Week 4 (6/10 - 6/14)
---

This week, I began processing the patches.  I received a zip file from Dr. Ghanbari containing all the historical patches, which were not categorized correctly. My goal is to filter out the patches that fail the test suite using Defects4J. To achieve this, I need to learn how to use Defects4J to verify the correctness of each patch.

Progress Update for this Week:

  - 6/10/2024
      - Checked out Defects4J bugs and applied patches to them but encountered a problem.  When I tried applying patches using the command "git apply <name_of_the_patch_file>", I got an error message saying that the patch failed as it does not apply.  Despite spending a significant amount of time trying to resolve the issue, I was unable to fix the problem. Therefore, I brought this issue up to Dr. Ghanbari.

      - On a group meeting today with Dr. Ghanbari and fellow students, we brainstormed solutions to the problem that I faced yesterday.  Dr. Ghanbari suggested that I should invert the patch.  Attempting the suggested solution, I discovered it did not resolve the issue. Even after inverting and reapplying the patch, I still received an error message indicating that the patch could not be applied. Additionally, when I tried running the test cases using the command "defects4j test," I encountered another error message stating that the directory I was in was not a valid working directory. This made me confused.

      - Fighting with the problem, I finally discovered its cause. Reviewing the Defects4J document, I realized that the "defects4j test" command depended on a specific structure, particularly in the working directory.  The working directory had to contain both the test data and the patched program.  With this in mind, I navigated to the correct directory and executed the program.  This helped resolved my issue and made me feel relieved.  However, this problem significantly impeded my progress for three days.         
  - 6/13/2024
      - Began processing the patches by checking out the buggy program for each directory within the zip file. Then, I applied the patches to their respective programs, generating patched versions. Afterward, I tested these patched programs against their corresponding test suites to assess each patch's correctness and effectiveness. Each folder contains varying numbers of patches, ranging from 1 to 10 per folder. This process is repeated for every directory, ensuring a thorough analysis of each patch.

      - Continued with yesterday's tasks.  This job is time-consuming and daunting, especially when considering the machine time needed to run the tests.
