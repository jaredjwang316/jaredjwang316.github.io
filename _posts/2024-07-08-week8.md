title: Week 8 (7/8 - 7/12)
---

This week, Hurricane Beryl hit Houston and greatly affected my community, leaving us without power and Wi-Fi access for several days. This caused me to be unable to work for 3 full days. Fortunately, on Wednesday night, I was able to check into a hotel to regain access to power and the internet. Once reconnected, I resumed the task from last week, focusing on analyzing and fixing the failed patches to ensure their tests pass.
