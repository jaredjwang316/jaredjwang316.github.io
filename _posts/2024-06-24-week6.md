title: Week 6 (6/24 - 6/28)
---

This week, I reworked the task of converting the Defects4J bugs into Maven projects after discovering issues with my previous script.  Then, I began working on the task of making all the patches pass their failed tests. To do this, I modified the source codes and then applied the patches to see if they would pass the tests.

Progress Update for this Week: 

  - 6/25/2024
      - Discussing with Dr. Ghanbari, I realized that my previous script for converting projects to Maven form was incomplete. It lacked some essential components of a Maven project.  
      - Researching on the internet, I discovered what constitutes a complete Maven project. A Maven project requires more than just a pom.xml file. It should also include the following directories:
          - src/main/java:
              - Purpose:
                  - This directory is intended for the main Java source code of the application. It is where all the core functionality of the project is implemented.
              - Functions:
                  - Houses all the Java classes and interfaces that form the application's business logic.
                  - The directory is organized into packages, which help in grouping related classes and managing the codebase efficiently.
                  - During compilation process, the source code in this directory is transformed into bytecode and placed in the target/classes directory.
                    
          - src/main/resources:
              - Purpose:
                  - This directory contains non-Java resource files needed by the application. These can include configuration files, properties files, XML files, and other types of files that the application might need at runtime.
              - Functions:
                  - Provides a central location for storing resources that the application will use during its execution.
                  - Commonly used for configuration files (e.g., application.properties, log4j.properties) which control various aspects of the applicationâ€™s behavior.
                  - During the build process, these resources are copied to the same output directory as the compiled Java classes (target/classes), making them accessible at runtime.

          - src/test/java:
              - Purpose:
                  - This directory is dedicated to Java test code. It contains the unit tests and integration tests for the application.
              - Functions:
                  - Stores test classes that verify the functionality of the code in src/main/java.  These tests are executed during the build process to ensure the correctness of the code.
                  - Frameworks like JUnit are often used to write tests in this directory.
                    
          - src/test/resources:
              - Purpose:
                  - This directory contains resource files needed specifically for testing, such as test data or configuration files for tests.
              - Functions:
                  - Stores resources required for executing tests, such as data files, mock configuration files, and other test-specific assets.
                  - Resources in this directory are kept separate from the main application resources to ensure a clean separation between test and production environments.
                  - During the test phase, these resources are copied to the target/test-classes directory, making them available to the test classes.

      - Applying the knowledge gained through research, I developed the following Bourne Shell Script to convert Defects4J bugs into Maven projects:

                                        # Define the base directory
                                        BASE_DIR="/home/jwangj001/patches-dataset"
                                        
                                        # Function to create a basic pom.xml file
                                        create_pom() {
                                            local project_dir=$1
                                            cat <<EOL > "$project_dir/pom.xml"

                                        echo "Conversion completed."
      - Executing this script, I successfully converted all the Defects4J bugs into Maven projects.
  - 6/27/2024
      - Started working on the next task of ensuring all patches pass their test cases by modifying the buggy programs.   
  - 6/28/2024
      - Continued the task from yesterday. I had a hard time getting the patches to pass their test cases, especially since I did not fully understand the source codes.  I started to suspect that my approach of modifying the buggy programs might not be the correct approach.
