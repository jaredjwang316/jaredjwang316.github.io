title: Week 2 (5/28 - 5/31)
---

During the second week of my internship, I continued to read research papers and deepen my understanding of the basic concepts related to my project, building on the knowledge I gained in the first week.  By the end of the week, I felt more prepared to begin working on my project.  

Progress Update for this Week:

  - 5/28/2024
      - Spent time reading the research paper on [Patch Correctness Assessment](https://ali-ghanbari.github.io/publications/issta22-shibboleth.pdf). 
  - 5/29/2024
      - Continued reading the research paper on [Patch Correctness Assessment](https://ali-ghanbari.github.io/publications/issta22-shibboleth.pdf).  After finishing this research paper, I got a better understanding on Shibboleth Technique, which evaluates patches generated by Automated Program Repair systems. Shibboleth uses textual and semantic similarity measures along with branch coverage to effectively rank and classify patches as correct or incorrect.
  - 5/30/2024
      - Attempted to install the Auburn VPN Server as next week's assignment will require access to a server. Despite using the correct username and password, I encountered a "failed login credentials" error message. My mentor is working with the Office of Information Technology to resolve this issue and will update me soon.
      - Learned PIT through hands-on practice.  I created a sample Java project using Maven in IntelliJ and PIT for mutation testing.  Although the project seems good, my mentor has some doubts and plans to discuss with me tomorrow with a Zoom call.
  - 5/31/2024
      - Spent time learning about Maven, exploring its structure and key components such as pom.xml files, dependencies, groupID, and artifactID.
      - Delved into the JUnit framework, understanding its functionality, and learning how to utilize annotations like @Before for setup tasks before testing, and @Test to indicate which methods are designated for testing. Practiced writing test cases with assertions using methods like assertEquals(expected, actual).
      - Met with my mentor via Zoom.  During the meeting, we updated the pom.xml file of my sample project, such as changing the JUnit version to 4.13.1, to better simulate the work environment for the actual project.  Additionally, my mentor demonstrated a real-world example of using Maven and PIT for mutation testing, which significantly enhanced my understanding of their practical applications.
