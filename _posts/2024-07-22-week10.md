      - I began writing my research report, focusing on the abstract, introduction, and background sections. To provide a solid foundation, I reviewed all the articles I had read throughout this internship, which helped me frame the context and relevance of my work. Reviewing those articles were essential in ensuring that my report was well-supported by existing literature work and clearly articulated the importance of my research.
