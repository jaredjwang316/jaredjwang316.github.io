title: Week 7 (7/1 - 7/5)
---

After realizing that my approach of modifying the buggy programs was incorrect, I reworked last week's task using a completely different method. This new approach allowed me to make significant progress on the task.

Progress Update for this Week:

  - 7/2/2024
      - Discussing with Dr. Ghanbari, I realized that modifying the source code was not the correct approach.  Instead, I should manually apply all the patches that failed the tests.
      - Searching on the internet, I learned how to create my own patch file and apply it to the source code.  To do so, I need to follow the procedures listed below:
          1. Copy the original source file to a new file using the linux command shown below:
          
                                             cp source_file.java source_file_original.java
          2. Edit the source_file.java file, manually applying the patch given in the .patch file into source_file.java.  To do so, I would use this linux command shown below:
   
                                                         nano source_file.java
          3. Use the "diff" command to create a patch file from the differences between the modified file and the original file as shown below:
   
                                                   diff -u source_file_original.java source_file.java > example.patch
          4. Apply the patch to the original, using the command shown below:
   
                                                              patch source_file_original.java < example.patch
          5. Verify the content of the patch to ensure that the patch was applied correctly using the command shown below:

                                                                 cat example.patch
