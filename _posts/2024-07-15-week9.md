title: Week 9 (7/15- 7/19)
---

This week, I continued the task of analyzing and fixing the failed patches to make their tests pass. 

Progress Update for this Week:

  - 7/15/2024
      - I resumed my work on fixing the failed patches. The progress was steady, and I began to develop a more systematic approach to this task. I felt that for every patch that I fixed, I learned something valuable.
  - 7/16/2024
      - During the group meeting, I shared my latest findings with Dr. Ghanbari, and he confirmed that I was on the right track. With his feedback, I felt like I have a good control on this task.  I predicted that I would complete it by the end of the week.   
  - 7/17/2024
      - I continued working on the patches.  To improve the efficiency of this task, I started grouping similar issues together, which helped me address them more effectively. This method not only saved time but also provided deeper insights into common patterns of failure.
  - 7/18/2024
      - For patches that applied cleanly but failed their tests, I spent time analyzing them to understand why they were semantically incorrect. After thoroughly examining the changes made by these patches, I realized that the modifications were fundamentally incorrect. I concluded that these patches needed to be discarded as they did not provide the correct fixes.
  - 7/19/2024
      - I continued to work on the patches with a focus on ensuring that they passed all the tests.
