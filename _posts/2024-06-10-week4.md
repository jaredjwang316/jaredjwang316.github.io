title: Week 4 (6/10 - 6/14)
---

This week, I continued working on the hands-on task from last week.  

Progress Update for this Week:

  - 6/10/2024
      - Continued the process of checking out Defects4J bugs and applying patches to them but encountered a problem.  When I tried applying patches using the command "git apply <name_of_the_patch_file>", I got an error message saying that the patch failed as it does not apply.  I examined the files and confirmed that they did include all the necessary dependencies such as "experimental," "lib," "org," and "source."  Despite spending a significant amount of time trying to resolve the issue, I was unable to fix the problem. Therefore, I brought this issue up to Dr. Ghanbari.
