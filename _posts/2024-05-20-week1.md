title: Week 1 (5/20 - 5/24)
---

Embarking on my research internship fills me with anticipation! I'm eager to hone my research skills and immerse myself in meaningful projects.  During my first week, I spent most of my time setting up my workspace and learning about the fundamentals of my project. 

Progress Update for this Week:

 - 5/20/2024
     - Got started by setting up the WSL Environment, Java, and Maven. I ran into a bit of trouble with setting up Maven, but with some hands-on guidance from my mentor, I managed to get my problems resolved by the end of the day.
 - 5/21/2024
     - Spent time reading a research paper on Defects4J, which gave me a clearer picture of my project.
     - Set up Defects4J on Linux and learned how to checkout bugs, which is an important skill needed for the project.
 - 5/22/2024
     - Spent time reading a research paper about Mutation Testing.
 - 5/23/2024
     - Spent most of the day traveling back to Houston, as I will be working remotely from now on.
 - 5/24/2024
     - Continued reading the research paper about Mutation Testing.  This paper helped enhance my understanding about the concept of Mutation Testing.  I now have a better grasp of the fundamentals of my project and feel more confident to begin working on my project sometime soon!
