title: Week 4 (6/10 - 6/14)
---

This week, I continued working on the hands-on task from last week.  

Progress Update for this Week:

  - 6/10/2024
      - Continued the process of checking out Defects4J bugs and applying patches to them but encountered a problem.  When I tried applying patches using the command "git apply <name_of_the_patch_file>", I got an error message saying that the patch failed as it does not apply.  Despite spending a significant amount of time trying to resolve the issue, I was unable to fix the problem. Therefore, I brought this issue up to Dr. Ghanbari.
  - 6/11/2024
      - Attended the weekly group meeting on Zoom with Dr. Ghanbari and fellow students, where we brainstormed solutions to the problem that I faced yesterday.  Dr. Ghanbari suggested that I should invert the patch.  
      - Later, I realized that inverting the patch was not the solution because, even after inverting and reapplying the patch, I still received an error message indicating that the patch could not be applied. Additionally, when I tried running the test cases using the command "defects4j test," I got an error message stating that the directory I was in was not a valid working directory. This made me feel confused, and I spent the whole night trying to determine the root cause of the problem, but I was unable to figure it out.
  - 6/12/2024
      - Continued trying to solve the problem I encountered yesterday. I finally figured out the cause of the issue. I realized that I ran the "defects4j test" command in the directory where I did not check out the buggy program. I recalled that in order to run and test a program, I need to feed the test data. To do so, I needed to be in the directory where I had checked out the buggy program. This way, I have access to the test data and can proceed with the task.       
  - 6/13/2024
      - Restarted the task with a fresh perspective, applying patches and running the test cases. I ensured that I was in the correct working directory where the buggy program was checked out, allowing me to access the necessary test data and proceed with verifying the patches. I recorded all the patches that failed their test cases for further analysis.
  - 6/14/2024
      - Continued the work from 6/13/2024, where I applied patches and ran test cases.
