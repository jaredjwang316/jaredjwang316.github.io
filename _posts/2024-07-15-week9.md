title: Week 9 (7/15 - 7/19)
---

This week, I knew what to do.  My task is to finish this project with 160 cases.  It is tedious, but this is part of the research.  

Progress Update for this Week:

  - 7/15/2024
      - I resumed my work on fixing the failed patches. The progress was steady, and I began to develop a more systematic approach to this task. I felt that for every patch that I fixed, I learned something valuable.
  - 7/16/2024
      - During the group meeting, I shared my latest findings with Dr. Ghanbari, and he confirmed that I was on the right track.  With his feedback, I felt like I have a good control on this task.  I anticipated that I would complete it by the end of the week.   
  - 7/17/2024
      - To improve the efficiency of this task, I started grouping similar issues together, which helped me address them more effectively.  This method not only saved time but also provided deeper insights into common patterns of failure.
  - 7/18/2024
      - I analyzed some cases where the patches were applied but failed their tests, and I found that the patch modifications on the source file were fundamentally incorrect.  As a conclusion, I recommended Dr. Ghanbari to discard these patches, as they did not provide the correct fixes.  
  - 7/19/2024
      - Continued to work on the patches with a focus on ensuring that they passed all the tests.  I anticipated that I can finish this task in 2 days.
