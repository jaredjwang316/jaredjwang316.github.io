title: Week 2 (5/28 - 5/31)
---

During the second week of my internship, I continued to read research papers and deepen my understanding of the basic concepts related to my project, building on the knowledge I gained in the first week.  By the end of the week, I felt more prepared to begin working on my project.  

Progress Update for this Week:

  - 5/28/2024
      - Spent time reading the research paper on [Patch Correctness Assessment] (https://ali-ghanbari.github.io/publications/issta22-shibboleth.pdf).

      - Continued reading the research paper on [Patch Correctness Assessment] (https://ali-ghanbari.github.io/publications/issta22-shibboleth.pdf).  After finishing this research paper, I got a better understanding on Shibboleth Technique, which evaluates patches generated by Automated Program Repair systems. Shibboleth uses textual and semantic similarity measures along with branch coverage to effectively rank and classify patches as correct or incorrect.

      - Attempted to install the Auburn VPN Server as next week's assignment will require access to a server. Despite using the correct username and password, I encountered a "failed login credentials" error message. My professor is working with the Office of Information Technology to resolve this issue.
      - Learned PIT through hands-on practice.  I created a simple Java project using Maven in IntelliJ and used PIT for mutation testing.  Although the project seems good, my mentor has some doubts and plans to discuss them with me tomorrow with a Zoom call.
